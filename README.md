# apihook
hooks up to api but with java

doesn't do much as of yet, but has stubs where we can write in functions, can start to implement the api stuff yay

The files I changed / made were User, Song, SpotifyExchange and I changed the other two a bunch too

This is a starting place, is not functional besides successfully connecting to the mysql database as I have it set up
